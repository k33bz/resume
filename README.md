My Resume in LaTeX
==================

This repository tracks changes to my resume from December 2014 onwards.

I used a base template as found here: http://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/resumes/

You may use this document as a template for your own resume (although I would suggest checking out the aforementioned link), however please keep in mind that you are not me, so please make the appropriate modifications to this file to make it your own.
